# Sundial2020

Project outline and key for a Sundial research project. In this project students use data from hydrodynamic simulations to estimate the amount of light that would be absorbed by the gas in the simulations in order to determine the best fit simulation to astronomical observations. The best fit is determined by a linear regession of the Chi-squared error between the simulated and observed absorption profile.
